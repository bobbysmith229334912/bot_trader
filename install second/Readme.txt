## Install Second

Now that Python and Visual Studio Code are installed, you can install the necessary Python libraries and run the trading bot.

1. Open the `install.py` script with Python. This will install the necessary libraries. If you see a message saying that all necessary libraries have been installed, it means this step was successful.
2. Navigate to the 'trading_bot_files' directory.
3. Open the `trading_bot.py` script with Python. This will run the trading bot.

If you encounter any issues, make sure that Python and Visual Studio Code were correctly installed, and try again. If the issue persists, contact [your contact information].
